# jj.js

This lightweight JavaScript library is distinguished by:
* its great performance
* the tiny file size
* low-code API syntax
* and easy readability

It should be seen as a basic library that is perfectly suitable for web developers who want to *avoid* large, slow frameworks like [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) or [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
