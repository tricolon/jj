# jj.js

This lightweight JavaScript library combines speed and small file size with a syntax designed for easy readability with little code. It should be seen as a basic library that is suitable for web developers who want to avoid large, slow libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap.

#### jj.js is perfectly suitable for:
* Advanced programmers who want to have their code under control and like to avoid the dead code of large libraries.
* Beginners, who understand JavaScript and now want to use a first library for their projects.
* Web developers for whom speed and reliability are a priority.
* Developers who are looking for alternatives to jQuery.

#### jj.js is less suitable for:
* Designers with hardly any programming skills.
* Web developers who can only handle jQuery, but not Vanilla JavaScript.
